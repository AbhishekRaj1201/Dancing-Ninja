# Dancing-Ninja
Dancing Ninja is a 3D game which is made using Unity Game Engine and all the scripts are written in C# in Visual Studio. 
This game is supported only on PC. In this game, I have created different dance moves using Animations and Mixamo Characters.                                                                                         How to Play? 
Press and Hold the Up, Down, Left, Right Arrow Keys to play different Dance moves. 
Also, Try Press and Hold Right Shift key for a bonus move. Hopefully you will Enjoy the Dance moves ;)
